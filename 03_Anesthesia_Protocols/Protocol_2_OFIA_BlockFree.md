## Educational Use Disclaimer

**This protocol is an educational framework, not an institutional clinical guideline or order set.**

- Developed for educational purposes and portfolio documentation.
- **Not approved** for clinical use without institutional review, pharmacy approval, and attending anesthesiologist oversight.
- Doses and workflows are **illustrative examples**; **institutional policies and attending judgment supersede**.
- Author is a pre-medical student; content reflects literature synthesis, not independent clinical authority.

**Clinical implementation requires:** attending validation, governance review, and local integration. No protocol substitutes for individualized patient assessment, informed consent, and clinician judgment.

---

## Failover Logic

- **Protocol 1 (Blocks + OFA)** is preferred when feasible for superior analgesia.
- **Protocol 2** is used when blocks are **contraindicated, declined, time-limited, or technically not feasible**.
- **If analgesia is inadequate despite optimized multimodal + surgeon infiltration** (or if ketamine/dex/lidocaine are not appropriate), transition to **Protocol 3 (opioid-inclusive)** with opioid stewardship principles.

---

## Why Choose This Pathway

### Advantages (when appropriately selected)
- Minimizes additional needle procedures (no regional block needles)
- Opioid-sparing / opioid-minimizing anesthetic strategy (goal: **opioid-free intraoperatively**, but **opioid rescue remains available**)
- Lower PONV risk compared with opioid-forward anesthesia, especially with propofol TIVA + guideline-based antiemetics
- Patient-centered option for severe needle aversion

### Critical success factor
**Robust surgeon local infiltration is essential.**  
Without high-quality surgical field infiltration, analgesia may be suboptimal and rescue analgesia requirements increase.

> Preoperative alignment with the surgeon is mandatory: agent choice, concentration, volume, and documentation.

---

## Indications

### Patient factors
- Patient declines regional blocks after informed discussion
- Needle phobia / strong preference to avoid additional needles
- ASA I–III (selected ASA IV by attending judgment)
- Apfel PONV score ≥2 (benefit amplified as risk increases)
- Patient understands that **pain control may be less robust than Protocol 1** and rescue analgesia may be required

### Common reasons blocks are not used
- Therapeutic anticoagulation / coagulopathy (per ASRA + local policy)
- Local infection at the planned block site
- Time constraints precluding safe block placement
- Anatomic/technical limitations (e.g., severe scarring/radiation, limited ultrasound windows)

### Surgical factors (selection guidance)
- Most appropriate for **mild–moderate complexity** revisions when surgeon infiltration is expected to be effective
- For **high-pain procedures** (e.g., extensive capsulectomy, ADM revision, major pocket rework), Protocol 1 is preferred when feasible

---

## Contraindications

### Absolute
| Contraindication | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Patient declines opioid-sparing / OFA strategy** | Respect autonomy; proceed to Protocol 3 |
| **Inability to perform adequate surgeon infiltration** | Analgesic foundation is insufficient without infiltration |
| **Severe intolerance/allergy to key multimodal components** (rare) | Requires individualized plan; often Protocol 3 |

### Relative (risk–benefit assessment)
| Consideration | Conservative approach |
|---|---|
| **Severe COPD / CO₂ retention / OSA** | Avoid sedating stacks; minimize benzodiazepines; consider enhanced monitoring/capnography; keep opioid rescue low-dose if needed |
| **Uncontrolled tachyarrhythmia** | Avoid higher-dose ketamine; prioritize depth and hemodynamic stability |
| **Baseline bradycardia / conduction disease** | Avoid dex bolus; use low-dose dex or omit; treat bradycardia promptly |
| **Significant hepatic dysfunction** | Reduce/avoid IV lidocaine infusion; consider acetaminophen limits; avoid polypharmacy |
| **Severe renal impairment** | Avoid NSAIDs/ketorolac; consider COX-2 selectively only if appropriate; adjust plan |
| **High-pain surgical plan** | Prefer Protocol 1 if feasible; otherwise consider Protocol 3 early rather than escalating sedating adjuncts |

---

## Special Populations and Delirium Risk Mitigation (Protocol 2 Addendum)

**This section supplements Protocol 2 to match the geriatric, delirium, and respiratory-risk specificity of Protocol 1.**  
Applies to all patients but is **mandatory review** for elderly, frail, cognitively vulnerable, OSA, or COPD populations.

---

## Special Populations: Required Modifications

### Elderly and/or Frail Patients (Age >70 or Clinical Frailty)

**Physiologic considerations:**
- Reduced cardiac output and hepatic clearance
- Increased CNS sensitivity to hypnotics and sedatives
- Higher risk of postoperative delirium and prolonged emergence

**Required anesthetic adjustments:**

| Agent | Standard Protocol 2 | Elderly / Frail Adjustment | Rationale |
|-----|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| **Propofol induction** | 1.5–2 mg/kg | **1–1.5 mg/kg** | Avoid hypotension and delayed emergence |
| **Propofol maintenance** | 75–150 mcg/kg/min | **50–100 mcg/kg/min** | Reduced clearance, ↑ brain sensitivity |
| **Dexmedetomidine** | 0.2–0.5 mcg/kg/hr | **0.2–0.3 mcg/kg/hr** | Bradycardia, delirium risk |
| **Ketamine (if used)** | 0.2–0.3 mg/kg | **0.1–0.2 mg/kg** | Reduce dysphoria, HTN, delirium |
| **Midazolam** | PRN | **Avoid if possible** (≤0.5–1 mg IV only if essential) | Strong delirium association |
| **Gabapentin** | Not routine | **AVOID** | Sedation, delirium, falls |

**Additional requirements:**
- **Processed EEG monitoring (BIS/Entropy) recommended**
- **Slower titration** of all IV agents
- **Early taper** of dexmedetomidine (≥15 min before emergence)
- **Lower threshold for extended PACU observation**

---

### Patients at High Risk for Postoperative Delirium

**Delirium risk factors (screen preoperatively):**
- Age >70
- Prior delirium or baseline cognitive impairment
- Frailty or poor functional reserve
- Polypharmacy (especially sedatives/anticholinergics)
- Sensory impairment (vision/hearing)
- Infection, anemia, dehydration
- Sleep deprivation
- Benzodiazepine exposure

**If ≥2 risk factors present → activate Delirium-Mitigation Bundle:**

#### Delirium-Mitigation Bundle
- **Avoid benzodiazepines** unless absolutely necessary
- **Avoid gabapentinoids**
- Use **lowest effective doses** of propofol, dexmedetomidine, ketamine
- **Stop dexmedetomidine early** (10–15 min before end)
- Maintain **normothermia**
- Avoid hypo- or hypercarbia (EtCO₂ 35–45 mmHg)
- Ensure **adequate analgesia** (pain itself precipitates delirium)
- Minimize anticholinergic exposure (use glycopyrrolate only if needed)
- **Early PACU reorientation:** lights on, glasses/hearing aids, calm environment

---

### Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and/or COPD

**Risks:**
- Sedative-induced hypoventilation
- Delayed emergence
- Opioid sensitivity (if rescue required)

**Protocol modifications:**

| Domain | Adjustment |
|------|-----------|
| **Sedatives** | Avoid stacking (dex + benzos + gabapentin) |
| **Midazolam** | Minimal dosing only if essential |
| **Dexmedetomidine** | Use low end of range; stop early |
| **Extubation** | Fully awake, head-up positioning |
| **PACU monitoring** | Continuous SpO₂; **consider capnography** |
| **Opioid rescue** | Lower doses, longer intervals, enhanced monitoring |

---

## PACU Scenario Management: Excessive Sedation (Protocol 2)

**More likely in Protocol 2** due to reliance on systemic adjuncts and anxiolysis.

### Recognition
- RASS ≤ -2
- Difficult to arouse or not following commands
- Adequate oxygenation but sluggish respiratory effort

### Common causes
- Residual dexmedetomidine
- Benzodiazepine effect (especially elderly/OSA)
- Propofol context-sensitive half-time
- Combined sedative exposure

### Management Algorithm

1. **Ensure airway patency and oxygenation**
   - Supplemental O₂
   - Continuous SpO₂
   - Consider capnography if ventilation is a concern

2. **Supportive care**
   - Time, stimulation, quiet environment
   - Avoid flumazenil unless benzodiazepine overdose suspected and risk–benefit assessed

3. **Do NOT discharge until:**
   - RASS ≥ -1 (preferably 0)
   - Consistently following commands
   - Stable ventilation without support

4. **Escalate if prolonged (>60–90 min)**
   - Attending evaluation
   - Consider monitored bed if recovery delayed

**Prevention (key):**
- Minimize benzodiazepines
- Avoid dex bolus
- Taper sedatives early
- Avoid sedative stacking

---

## Discharge Hard-Stops for High-Risk Patients

**Do NOT discharge if any of the following persist:**
- RASS ≤ -1
- Uncontrolled pain (NRS >4 despite plan)
- Ongoing hypoxia or hypoventilation
- Active delirium, agitation, or confusion
- Recurrent PONV
- Hemodynamic instability

**Consider extended observation or admission** for:
- Elderly with delayed emergence
- OSA with opioid rescue
- Any patient with suspected delirium

---

## Documentation Requirements (High-Risk Populations)

**Preoperative note must include:**
- Delirium risk assessment (if present)
- Explicit plan to minimize sedatives
- Rationale for Protocol 2 selection over Protocol 1

**PACU handoff must include:**
- Total sedative exposure (benzodiazepines, dex, ketamine)
- Delirium risk status
- Monitoring requirements and discharge cautions

---

**End of Protocol 2 Addendum — Geriatric, Delirium, and Respiratory Safety**

## Required Equipment and Preparation

### Monitoring
**Standard ASA monitors**
- ECG, pulse oximetry, NIBP (q3–5 min), capnography (airway), temperature, inspired/expired gas analysis

**Consider**
- Processed EEG (BIS/Entropy) in elderly/frail or when tight depth control is desired
- Arterial line only for significant cardiac disease per attending judgment

### Airway equipment
- Video laryngoscope (preferred)
- ETT and/or SGA (LMA) options per case and aspiration risk

---

## Preoperative Preparation

### Multimodal oral premedication (1–2 hours preop)
| Medication | Dose | Indications | Contraindications |
|---|---:|---|---|
| **Acetaminophen** | 1000 mg PO | Most patients | Severe hepatic impairment; adhere to max daily dose per policy |
| **Celecoxib** | 200–400 mg PO | If no renal/GI contraindications | eGFR <30, active PUD, ASA/NSAID hypersensitivity |
| **Gabapentin** | **Not routine** | Consider only for neuropathic phenotype in carefully selected patients | Older age, cognitive impairment, OSA/high delirium risk |

**Gabapentin note (educational):**
- Many ERAS pathways do **not** recommend routine gabapentinoids due to sedation/delirium and modest benefit.
- If used: keep **low-dose** (e.g., 100–300 mg) and document rationale.

### Anxiolysis (needle phobia approach — conservative and safe)
Aim: calm, cooperative, **spontaneously ventilating** patient with minimal residual sedation.

| Medication | Suggested dosing | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Midazolam** | 0.5–2 mg IV titrated | Use the lowest effective dose; avoid “liberal” dosing; higher doses increase delayed emergence and respiratory risk (especially OSA/COPD) |
| **Non-pharmacologic** | topical anesthetic, calm environment, minimize visible needles | Often reduces need for benzodiazepines |

> Oral midazolam and high-dose benzodiazepines are **institution-specific** and generally avoided in outpatient settings without defined monitoring pathways.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis (examples; policy supersedes)
| Weight | Medication | Timing |
|---|---|---|
| <120 kg | Cefazolin 2 g IV | 30–60 min before incision |
| ≥120 kg | Cefazolin 3 g IV | 30–60 min before incision |
| β-lactam allergy | Vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV (max 2 g) | Start 60–120 min before incision |

### PONV prophylaxis (Apfel-based examples)
| Apfel score | Suggested prophylaxis |
|---:|---|
| 2 | Dexamethasone 4–8 mg IV |
| 3 | Dexamethasone 4–8 mg IV + ondansetron 4 mg IV near emergence |
| 4 | Dexamethasone + ondansetron + scopolamine patch ± additional agent per policy |

---

## Surgeon Local Infiltration (Non-Negotiable Component)

### Pre-incision coordination checklist
Before incision, confirm:
- **Agent, concentration, planned volume**
- Estimated total mg and patient weight-based maximums
- Documentation plan (surgeon documents infiltration details)

### Preferred infiltration principles (conservative)
- Use **one long-acting local anesthetic** strategy when possible
- Incremental infiltration along incision, pocket planes, and near drains
- Avoid exceeding weight-based dose limits and avoid stacking multiple amide locals without explicit calculation

**Examples (institution-dependent; illustrative):**
- Ropivacaine 0.2–0.375% total 20–40 mL (calculate mg)
- Bupivacaine 0.25% total 20–30 mL (calculate mg)

> If IV lidocaine infusion is used, avoid additional **lidocaine** infiltration unless a deliberate total-dose calculation supports it and institutional policy allows.

### Local anesthetic dose safety (educational)
- Calculate total mg = (mL) × (mg/mL)
- Confirm planned total mg < maximum mg by weight per institutional policy
- Document cumulative exposure (including any IV lidocaine infusion)

---

## Induction of General Anesthesia (Opioid-Sparing / Opioid-Free Goal)

### Pre-induction
- Standard monitors on, baseline vitals
- Preoxygenation 100% O₂ for 3–5 minutes (target EtO₂ >90%)

### Induction sequence (example; conservative)
| Step | Agent | Dose | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Lidocaine (optional) | 1–1.5 mg/kg IV (max per policy) | Blunt airway response | Consider omitting in conduction disease; policy dependent |
| 2 | Ketamine (optional) | **0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV** | Analgesic adjunct | Do **not** frame as “essential”; benefit is phenotype- and risk-dependent |
| 3 | Propofol | 1.5–2 mg/kg IV | Hypnosis | Reduce to 1–1.5 mg/kg in elderly/frail/ASA III–IV |
| 4 | Rocuronium | 0.6–1 mg/kg IV | NMB | RSI as indicated |

**Why ketamine is kept conservative here**
- Higher ketamine dosing increases dysphoria and sympathetic effects and may not improve analgesia proportionally.
- Without blocks, analgesia should be driven by **surgeon infiltration + non-opioid multimodal**, with ketamine used selectively.

**Ketamine contraindications / strong cautions**
- Active psychosis
- Uncontrolled hypertension (e.g., SBP >180)
- Unstable angina/recent MI (relative; attending judgment)
- Significant tachyarrhythmia

---

## Maintenance of Anesthesia

### Hypnosis (choose one)
**Option A: Propofol TIVA (preferred for high PONV risk)**
- 75–150 mcg/kg/min (elderly/frail: 50–100 mcg/kg/min)
- Target BIS 40–60 (if used) or clinical depth markers

**Option B: Volatile**
- 0.7–1.0 MAC (age-adjusted)

### Multimodal adjuncts (selective; avoid “stacking” into harm)

#### Dexmedetomidine infusion (optional)
- **Avoid loading bolus**
- 0.2–0.5 mcg/kg/hr (elderly/frail: 0.2–0.4)
- Taper/stop 10–15 minutes before end if prolonged sedation is a concern

**Avoid or use extreme caution**
- Baseline bradycardia, high-grade AV block without pacemaker
- Significant conduction disease
- Frailty/high delirium risk (dose minimization)

#### IV lidocaine infusion (institution dependent; optional)
- Typical: 1–1.5 mg/kg/hr (conservative) after induction bolus if used
- Reduce/avoid in hepatic dysfunction or conduction disease; follow policy

#### Ketamine intraop (optional)
- Prefer **microboluses** 10–20 mg for high-stimulus moments **only if needed**
- Avoid routine high cumulative doses without clear indication

> Principle: **optimize hypnotic depth and infiltration first**, then add adjuncts.

### Ventilation strategy (lung-protective)
- VT 6–8 mL/kg IBW, PEEP 5–8 cm H₂O, EtCO₂ ~35–45 mmHg
- FiO₂ lowest to maintain SpO₂ >94%

---

## Intraoperative Management

### Hemodynamic goals (example)
- MAP 65–90 or within ±20% baseline (patient-specific)
- HR 50–90 bpm (patient-specific)

### Hypotension management (algorithmic)
1. Assess depth/vasodilation/volume status
2. **If hypotension + bradycardia** (dex-pattern):
   - Reduce/stop dex
   - Consider glycopyrrolate if symptomatic
   - Consider ephedrine 5–10 mg IV if both HR and BP low
3. **If hypotension without bradycardia:**
   - Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV (or infusion per policy)
4. Reassess repeatedly; avoid reflexive fluid boluses

### Fluids
- Goal-directed, avoid overload; vasopressors for vasodilation when appropriate

### Temperature
- Maintain normothermia (>36°C)

---

## Emergence and Extubation

### Taper plan (10–15 minutes pre-end)
- Reduce/stop dex
- Stop lidocaine at closure (or per local postop pathway)
- Stop ketamine infusion (if used) 5–10 minutes before end
- Taper hypnotic for smooth awakening

### Antiemetics
- Ondansetron 4 mg IV near emergence for Apfel ≥2 if not already administered

### Reversal
- Sugammadex per TOF depth or neostigmine/glyco per policy

### Extubation criteria
- Awake, following commands
- Adequate ventilation/oxygenation
- Hemodynamic stability
- TOF ratio >0.9

---

## PACU Management

### Expected course (typical, not guaranteed)
- Pain is **more variable** than Protocol 1 and is highly dependent on infiltration quality
- Lower PONV relative to opioid-forward approaches when TIVA + prophylaxis used
- Potentially longer PACU time due to analgesic titration

## Expected Clinical Outcomes (Protocol 2)

| Metric | Protocol 2 Target | Comparison |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| **PACU Pain (NRS)** | 3-6/10 | Protocol 1: 1-3/10 |
| **Rescue Analgesia Needed** | 20-40% | Protocol 1: <20% |
| **PONV Incidence** | 10-15% | Protocol 1: 3-8%; Protocol 3: 25-40% |
| **Time to Discharge** | 90-120 min | Protocol 1: 60-90 min |

**Key Point:** Higher analgesic requirements expected vs Protocol 1 due to lack of regional blocks. This is anticipated and managed with multimodal rescue strategies.

### Monitoring
- Vitals q15 min initially → q30 min when stable
- Continuous SpO₂ until stable/awake; consider capnography for OSA/COPD or significant sedation

### Scheduled non-opioid analgesics (examples; policy supersedes)
| Medication | Dose | Frequency | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Acetaminophen | 1000 mg PO | q6h scheduled | max daily dose per policy/hepatic status |
| NSAID/COX-2 | per policy | scheduled/PRN | select based on renal/GI/bleeding risk |

**Ketorolac example (if allowed):**
- Ketorolac 15 mg IV q6h **with explicit institutional maximum daily dose and duration**
- Avoid in CKD, bleeding risk, active PUD, NSAID allergy

### Rescue analgesia (stepwise; conservative)
If NRS ≥4:
1. Confirm infiltration effect and rule out surgical complications (hematoma, tight pocket, etc.)
2. Consider non-opioid rescue:
   - Ketamine 10–20 mg IV (if permitted and appropriate)
3. If inadequate or contraindicated:
   - Opioid rescue using small, titrated doses with monitoring

## Analgesic Escalation Strategy (If Initial Multimodal Inadequate)

**If pain remains NRS ≥6 despite:**
- Optimized surgeon infiltration
- Dexmedetomidine 0.2-0.5 mcg/kg/hr
- Ketamine 0.2-0.3 mg/kg
- Lidocaine infusion

**Consider (attending discretion):**
- Ketamine dose escalation to 0.3-0.5 mg/kg (if no contraindications)
- Dexmedetomidine escalation to 0.5-0.7 mcg/kg/hr (monitor for bradycardia)
- Earlier opioid rescue (small titrated doses)
- **OR transition to Protocol 3** for subsequent cases with this patient

**Important:** Escalation must account for cumulative sedative burden and emergence timing.

**Opioid rescue (examples)**
| Phenotype | Hydromorphone dose | Interval | Monitoring |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Elderly/frail/OSA | 0.2 mg IV | q20–30 min | enhanced monitoring |
| Typical adult | 0.2–0.4 mg IV | q15–20 min | continuous SpO₂ until stable |
| Chronic opioid use | 0.4–0.8 mg IV | q15–20 min | tolerance expected; attending oversight |

**Escalation triggers**
- High rescue requirements
- Persistent pain despite rescue
- Excessive sedation
- Suspected complication  
→ attending evaluation; consider monitored bed; consider conversion to Protocol 3 logic for subsequent cases.

### PONV management (avoid repeating same class)
- Follow institutional stepwise rescue antiemetic algorithm

### Discharge readiness (institutional)
- Modified Aldrete ≥9 (or institutional standard)
- Pain and nausea controlled with plan
- Stable vitals, appropriate mental status, oxygenation adequate

---

## Key Safety Considerations

### Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST)
- Ensure total mg calculations include surgeon infiltration and any IV lidocaine infusion
- Monitor for early neurologic symptoms; have lipid emulsion available
- Follow institutional LAST checklist (ASRA-aligned)

### Sedation and respiratory safety
- Avoid high-dose benzodiazepines, especially in OSA/COPD/elderly
- Minimize sedating adjunct stacking (dex + benzos + gabapentinoids)
- Use enhanced monitoring when risk is elevated

### Dexmedetomidine adverse effects
- Bradycardia/hypotension; avoid bolus; titrate low; stop early in emergence if needed

### Ketamine adverse effects
- Sympathomimetic HTN/tachycardia; dysphoria
- Use selectively; avoid high-risk phenotypes

---

## Documentation Requirements (Educational Template)

### Preop
- Consent for GA and opioid-sparing plan + rescue option
- Apfel score and prophylaxis plan
- Document reason blocks not used and infiltration plan confirmed

### Intraop
- Record anesthetic technique and adjunct dosing
- Document surgeon infiltration: agent/concentration/volume/total mg
- Document hemodynamics and interventions

### PACU handoff
- Opioid exposure (goal: minimal)
- Infiltration details and expected analgesic window
- Rescue plan and monitoring risk factors
