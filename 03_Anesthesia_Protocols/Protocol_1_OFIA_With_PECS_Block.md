## Educational Use Disclaimer

**This protocol is an educational framework, not an institutional clinical guideline or an order set.**

- Developed for educational purposes and portfolio documentation.
- **Not approved** for clinical implementation without institutional review, pharmacy approval, and attending anesthesiologist oversight.
- Doses and workflows are **illustrative examples**; **institutional policies, local formularies, and attending judgment supersede**.
- Author is a pre-medical student; content reflects literature synthesis, not independent clinical authority.

**Clinical implementation requires:** attending validation, governance review, and local integration. No protocol substitutes for individualized patient assessment, informed consent, and clinician judgment.

---

## Failover Logic

This pathway is **preferred** when regional anesthesia is feasible and appropriate.

- **If blocks are contraindicated, declined, time-limited, or technically unsuccessful:** transition to **Protocol 2 (systemic multimodal, opioid-sparing)** with opioid rescue as needed.
- **If multimodal is insufficient or patient risk profile requires opioid-forward strategy:** transition to **Protocol 3 (opioid-inclusive)**.

---

## Why This Is the Preferred First-Line Pathway (When Feasible)

**Expected benefits (directional, not guaranteed):**
- High-quality analgesia from regional anesthesia plus multimodal systemic adjuncts
- Reduced opioid exposure and **lower PONV risk** compared with opioid-forward techniques, especially with propofol TIVA + guideline-based prophylaxis
- Smooth emergence profile when depth and hemodynamics are well controlled
- Favorable recovery metrics (analgesia, alertness, mobilization readiness)

**Best suited for:**
- High PONV risk patients (Apfel ≥3)
- Extensive dissection (e.g., Baker Grade III–IV capsular contracture)
- Suspected implant infection with washout
- Patients with difficult emergence history (when physiology supports OFA adjuncts)
- Patient preference for opioid-sparing techniques
- Revision complexity anticipated (pocket work, ADM revision)

**Evidence base (anchor categories):**
- Regional anesthesia guidance for breast surgery (e.g., ASRA)
- ERAS-oriented pathways for breast reconstruction
- RCTs/meta-analyses supporting PECS/SAP efficacy for breast procedures
- Opioid stewardship and multimodal perioperative analgesia guidance (ASA/APSF/ERAS)

> Note: Where numerical outcome benchmarks are shown, they should be treated as **institution- and population-dependent**; use local QI data where available.

---

## Indications

### Surgical
- Post-mastectomy implant revision (any etiology)
- Capsular contracture (Baker I–IV)
- Implant malposition/rotation
- Size exchange, implant removal
- Suspected/confirmed infection requiring washout
- ADM revision

### Patient factors
- ASA I–III (selected ASA IV by attending judgment)
- Apfel PONV score ≥2 (strong preference ≥3)
- Patient consent for regional anesthesia
- Can tolerate positioning for block placement

---

## Contraindications

### Absolute
| Contraindication | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Local infection at block site** | Risk of deep tissue inoculation |
| **True amide local anesthetic allergy** | No safe regional alternative |
| **Patient refusal after informed discussion** | Respect autonomy; proceed to Protocol 2/3 |
| **Uncorrected coagulopathy with active bleeding** | Unacceptable bleeding risk |

### Relative (risk–benefit assessment required)
| Consideration | Practical approach |
|---|---|
| **Therapeutic anticoagulation** | Manage per ASRA/ institutional anticoagulation guidance; balance urgency vs bleeding risk |
| **Severe COPD / CO₂ retention** | Avoid sedating stacks; consider minimizing/avoiding dex bolus; enhanced respiratory monitoring |
| **Baseline bradycardia (HR <50)** | Avoid dex bolus; low-dose infusion only if needed; continuous HR/BP monitoring |
| **Significant hepatic dysfunction** | Reduce/avoid IV lidocaine infusion; monitor for toxicity |
| **Renal impairment (severe)** | Avoid NSAIDs/ketorolac; use COX-2 selectively if appropriate; adjust plan |
| **Prior chest wall radiation** | Tissue fibrosis may complicate plane identification; ultrasound optimization |
| **Morbid obesity** | Increased technical difficulty; consider SAP alternative; needle length/positioning adjustments |

---

## Required Equipment and Preparation

### Regional anesthesia equipment
- Ultrasound: high-frequency linear probe (10–15 MHz), sterile sleeve/gel
- Needle: 22G echogenic block needle 80–100 mm + extension tubing

### Local anesthetic (choose ONE)
**Preferred:** Ropivacaine 0.2%  
- Lower cardiotoxicity than bupivacaine  
- **Typical volume:** **30–40 mL per side** for PECS I + II (i.e., **60–80 mL bilateral**)  
- Dose and volume must respect **mg/kg limits** (see dosing table)

**Alternative:** Bupivacaine 0.25%  
- Longer duration potential  
- Higher cardiotoxicity risk; strict incremental injection and aspiration  
- **Typical volume:** **25–35 mL per side** (i.e., **50–70 mL bilateral**)

**Optional additives (institution dependent):**
- Dexamethasone 2–4 mg (block prolongation; route and dosing per institutional policy)
- Epinephrine 1:200,000–1:400,000 (may reduce systemic absorption and serve as intravascular marker)

### Safety equipment
- 20% lipid emulsion immediately available (LAST)
- Resuscitation cart with airway equipment
- ACLS medications

### Monitoring
**Standard ASA monitors**
- ECG, pulse oximetry, NIBP (q3–5 min), capnography (airway), temperature, gas analysis

**Consider**
- Processed EEG (BIS/Entropy) in older/frail patients or when depth precision is desired
- Arterial line only for significant cardiac disease per attending judgment

---

## Preoperative Preparation

### Multimodal oral premedication (1–2 hours preop)
| Medication | Dose | Indications | Contraindications |
|---|---:|---|---|
| **Acetaminophen** | 1000 mg PO | Most patients | Severe hepatic impairment |
| **Celecoxib** | 200–400 mg PO | If no renal/GI contraindications | eGFR <30, active PUD, ASA/NSAID hypersensitivity |
| **Gabapentin** | **Not routine** | Consider only for neuropathic pain phenotype or specific indications per attending | Older age, cognitive impairment, OSA, high delirium risk |

**Gabapentin note (educational):**
- Many modern ERAS pathways do **not** recommend routine perioperative gabapentinoids due to sedation/delirium and modest benefit.
- If used: consider **low-dose** (e.g., 100–300 mg) in carefully selected patients.

### Anxiolysis (block room, if needed)
| Medication | Dose | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| **Midazolam** | 1–2 mg IV | Titrate slowly; avoid or minimize in elderly/OSA/high delirium risk |

### Antibiotic prophylaxis (examples; institutional policy supersedes)
| Weight | Medication | Timing |
|---|---|---|
| <120 kg | Cefazolin 2 g IV | 30–60 min before incision |
| ≥120 kg | Cefazolin 3 g IV | 30–60 min before incision |
| β-lactam allergy | Vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV (max 2 g) | Start 60–120 min before incision |

**Redosing:** per institutional policy (cefazolin commonly q4h if prolonged case).

### PONV prophylaxis (Apfel-based; examples)
| Apfel score | Suggested prophylaxis |
|---:|---|
| 2 | Dexamethasone 4–8 mg IV |
| 3 | Dexamethasone 4–8 mg IV + Ondansetron 4 mg IV near emergence |
| 4 | Dexamethasone + ondansetron + scopolamine patch ± additional agent per policy |

---

## Regional Block Technique

### Positioning / sterile prep
- Supine, arm abducted ~90° on armboard
- Sterile prep (chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine), sterile probe cover/gel
- **Time-out:** correct patient/site, LA concentration/total dose, allergies, lipid availability

### PECS I
- Plane: between pectoralis major and pectoralis minor
- Volume: **10–15 mL per side** (0.2% ropi or 0.25% bupi)

### PECS II
- Plane: between pectoralis minor and serratus anterior (interfascial plane)
- Volume: **20–25 mL per side** (0.2% ropi or 0.25% bupi)

### Alternative: Serratus Anterior Plane (SAP)
- If PECS II difficult: SAP more superficial and often easier in obesity
- Volume: **20–25 mL per side** typical (respect dose limits)

### Local anesthetic dosing and safety

**Typical bilateral PECS I + II dosing (examples; adjust by weight and policy):**

| LA | Typical bilateral volume | Concentration | mg/mL | Typical total mg | Common max (mg/kg)* |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Ropivacaine | 60–80 mL | 0.2% | 2 mg/mL | 120–160 mg | ~3 mg/kg |
| Bupivacaine | 50–70 mL | 0.25% | 2.5 mg/mL | 125–175 mg | ~2–2.5 mg/kg |

\* Max dose varies by institutional policy, additives, and patient factors. Use local standards and conservative dosing.

**Injection safety**
- Aspirate prior to injection and **every 3–5 mL**
- Incremental injection with continuous monitoring
- Stop immediately if symptoms suggest intravascular injection or toxicity

**LAST monitoring**
- Early: perioral numbness, metallic taste, tinnitus, dizziness, agitation
- Severe: seizures, arrhythmias, cardiovascular collapse  
- Lipid emulsion must be immediately accessible (see LAST section)

### Block assessment
- Sensory test (cold/pinprick) over expected dermatomes (approx T2–T6) after 5–10 minutes
- Document distribution and adequacy
- If inadequate: plan for surgeon infiltration and systemic multimodal escalation; opioid rescue if needed

---

## Induction of General Anesthesia (Opioid-Free)

### Pre-induction
- Standard monitors on; baseline vitals
- Preoxygenation 100% O₂ for 3–5 minutes (target EtO₂ >90%)

### Induction sequence (example)
| Step | Agent | Dose | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Lidocaine | 1–1.5 mg/kg IV (max per policy) | Blunt airway reflexes/sympathetic response | Consider omitting if conduction disease; institutional policy |
| 2 | Ketamine (optional) | 0.2–0.3 mg/kg IV | Analgesic adjunct (phenotype-matched) | Avoid/limit in uncontrolled HTN/unstable CAD/psychosis |
| 3 | Propofol | 1.5–2 mg/kg IV | Hypnosis | Reduce to 1–1.5 mg/kg in elderly/frail/ASA III–IV |
| 4 | Rocuronium | 0.6–1 mg/kg IV | NMB | RSI as indicated |

**Ketamine contraindications / strong cautions (educational):**
- Active psychosis
- Uncontrolled hypertension (e.g., SBP >180)
- Unstable angina/recent MI (relative; attending judgment)
- Severe catecholamine-depleted states (relative)

### Airway
- ETT preferred for controlled ventilation; LMA acceptable for short case + low aspiration risk per attending
- Confirm with continuous EtCO₂ waveform and auscultation

---

## Maintenance of Anesthesia

### Hypnosis (choose one)
**Option A: Propofol TIVA (preferred for high PONV risk)**
- 75–150 mcg/kg/min (elderly/frail: 50–100 mcg/kg/min)
- Target BIS 40–60 if using processed EEG (or clinical depth markers)

**Option B: Volatile (sevo/des)**
- 0.7–1.0 MAC (age-adjusted)

### Core multimodal adjuncts (examples; titrate to physiology)

#### Dexmedetomidine infusion
- **Avoid loading bolus** (or use only very low/slow bolus per attending)
- 0.2–0.5 mcg/kg/hr (elderly/frail: 0.2–0.4)
- Taper/stop ~10–15 minutes before end if prolonged sedation is a concern

**High-risk situations (use caution / consider avoidance):**
- Baseline bradycardia, high-grade AV block without pacemaker
- Significant conduction disease
- Frailty/high delirium risk (dose minimization)

#### IV lidocaine infusion (institution dependent)
- Typical: 1–2 mg/kg/hr (often 1–1.5) after an induction bolus if used
- Reduce/avoid in hepatic dysfunction, conduction disease, or per policy

#### Ketamine (optional; phenotype-matched)
- Induction-only 0.2–0.3 mg/kg **or**
- Microboluses 10–20 mg for high stimulus (track cumulative dose) **or**
- Low infusion 0.1–0.2 mg/kg/hr in selected patients per policy

> Ketamine is an **analgesic adjunct**, not a substitute for adequate hypnotic depth.

### Ventilation strategy (lung-protective)
| Parameter | Target |
|---|---|
| VT | 6–8 mL/kg IBW |
| PEEP | 5–8 cm H₂O |
| EtCO₂ | ~35–45 mmHg (adjust to physiology) |
| FiO₂ | lowest to maintain SpO₂ >94% (avoid prolonged FiO₂ >0.8 unless needed) |

---

## Intraoperative Management

### Hemodynamic goals (example)
- MAP 65–90 mmHg or within ±20% baseline (patient-specific)
- HR 50–90 bpm (physiology and comorbidity dependent)

### Hypotension management (algorithmic)
1. **Assess cause:** depth, vasodilation, hypovolemia, bradycardia, ventilation/EtCO₂
2. **If hypotension with bradycardia (dex-pattern likely):**
   - Reduce/stop dex infusion
   - Consider glycopyrrolate if symptomatic
   - Consider **ephedrine 5–10 mg IV** if both HR and BP low
3. **If hypotension without bradycardia:**
   - **Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV** (or infusion per policy)
4. **If persistent:**
   - Reassess volume status, bleeding, anesthetic depth, and consider vasopressor escalation per attending

### Bradycardia management
- HR 45–50 and asymptomatic: reduce dex and observe
- HR <45 or symptomatic: stop dex, glycopyrrolate 0.2–0.4 mg IV
- Severe: atropine per ACLS/attending judgment

### Fluids (ERAS-oriented)
- Balanced, goal-directed approach; avoid reflexive fluid loading
- Use vasopressors for vasodilation when appropriate rather than excessive crystalloid

### Temperature
- Maintain normothermia (>36°C) with forced air warming and warmed fluids as needed

---

## Emergence and Extubation

### Taper plan (10–15 minutes pre-end)
- Reduce/stop dex (consider taper to avoid prolonged sedation)
- Stop lidocaine at closure (or per institutional postop infusion pathway)
- Stop ketamine infusion (if used) 5–10 minutes before end
- Taper hypnotic for smooth wake-up

### Antiemetics
- Ondansetron 4 mg IV near emergence for Apfel ≥2 if not already administered

### Reversal
- Sugammadex 2–4 mg/kg per TOF depth **or** neostigmine/glyco per policy and TOF requirements

### Extubation criteria
- Awake, following commands
- Adequate ventilation and oxygenation
- Hemodynamically stable
- TOF ratio >0.9 (objective confirmation preferred)

---

## PACU Management

### Expected course (typical, not guaranteed)
- Pain often mild when blocks effective
- Low PONV when TIVA + prophylaxis used
- Discharge readiness per institutional criteria

### Monitoring
- Vitals q15 min initially → q30 min when stable
- Continuous SpO₂ until stable and awake
- RASS and pain scores at regular intervals

### Scheduled non-opioid analgesics (examples; institutional policy supersedes)
| Medication | Dose | Frequency | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Acetaminophen | 1000 mg PO | q6h scheduled | consider max daily dose and hepatic status |
| NSAID/COX-2 | per policy | scheduled/PRN | choose based on renal/GI/bleeding risk |

**Ketorolac example (if allowed):**
- Ketorolac 15 mg IV q6h **with explicit institutional maximum daily dose and duration**
- Avoid in CKD, bleeding risk, active PUD, NSAID allergy

### Rescue analgesia
If NRS ≥4 despite scheduled multimodal:
1. **Assess block function** (sensory distribution, failure suspicion)
2. **If block adequate but pain persists:**
   - Consider ketamine 10–20 mg IV (if permitted and appropriate), OR
   - Opioid rescue per phenotype (below)
3. **If block failure suspected:**
   - Surgeon infiltration, attending evaluation, consider rescue block
   - Opioid rescue as needed

**Opioid rescue (examples; titrate carefully)**
| Phenotype | Hydromorphone dose | Interval | Monitoring |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Elderly/frail/OSA | 0.2 mg IV | q20–30 min | enhanced monitoring, consider capnography |
| Typical adult | 0.2–0.4 mg IV | q15–20 min | continuous SpO₂ until stable |
| Chronic opioid use | 0.4–0.8 mg IV | q15–20 min | tolerance expected; attending oversight |

If escalating requirements:
- Reassess diagnosis (hematoma, ischemia, block failure)
- Consider ketamine infusion per policy
- Consider monitored bed if sedation/OSA risk

### PONV treatment (stepwise; avoid repeating same class)
- Rescue antiemetic per institutional algorithm (e.g., dopamine antagonist if ondansetron already used)

### Discharge readiness
- Modified Aldrete ≥9 (or institutional standard)
- Pain and nausea controlled with a plan
- Stable vitals, oxygenation, mental status appropriate

---

## Postoperative Analgesia (Home) — Example Plan

**Scheduled (48–72 hours, if appropriate):**
- Acetaminophen + NSAID/COX-2 per renal/GI risk and policy  
- Provide explicit max daily acetaminophen guidance and avoidance conditions

**Rescue opioid (selective, minimal):**
- Oxycodone 5 mg PO q4–6h PRN severe pain  
- Dispense minimal quantity per opioid stewardship and local policy  
- Provide storage/disposal counseling

> Many patients with effective blocks + multimodal regimen may require **little or no** opioid; prescribing is individualized.

---

## Key Safety Considerations

### LAST (Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity)
**Prevention**
- Weight-based dosing; calculate total mg before draw-up
- Incremental injection with aspiration
- Avoid high-risk concentrations when large volumes required

**Recognition**
- CNS symptoms → seizures → cardiovascular collapse

**Immediate treatment (overview; institutional LAST protocol supersedes)**
1. Stop injection; call for help
2. Airway support, 100% O₂
3. Treat seizures with benzodiazepines (avoid large propofol boluses in CV collapse)
4. **20% lipid emulsion** per ASRA checklist (bolus then infusion)
5. ACLS modifications (reduced epinephrine doses; avoid vasopressin, CCBs, beta-blockers in LAST)

### Dexmedetomidine adverse effects
- Bradycardia/hypotension (dose-dependent); avoid bolus; titrate low
- Stop/reduce for HR <50 (patient-specific) or symptomatic hypotension

### Ketamine adverse effects
- Sympathomimetic HTN/tachycardia
- Dysphoria/emergence phenomena (rare at analgesic dosing; treat with reassurance ± low-dose benzodiazepine)
- Avoid in active psychosis; caution in unstable CAD/uncontrolled HTN

---

## Troubleshooting (Common Scenarios)

### Inadequate block coverage
- Confirm anatomy/dermatomes
- Add surgeon infiltration
- Escalate systemic multimodal adjuncts
- Opioid rescue if needed; attending evaluation; consider rescue block if feasible

### Excessive PACU sedation
- Common drivers: dex context effect, residual hypnotic, gabapentinoid exposure
- Supportive care + monitoring; delay discharge until RASS appropriate; consider capnography if OSA risk

### Intraoperative hypertension
- Check depth first (increase hypnotic before “treating numbers”)
- Check EtCO₂, bladder, stimulation timing
- Avoid assuming ketamine is the primary cause without confirming depth

### Bradycardia during maintenance
- Reduce/stop dex; treat if symptomatic or profound
- Consider ephedrine if concurrent hypotension + bradycardia

---

## Special Populations (Selected Modifiers)

### Elderly/frail
- Reduce induction/maintenance hypnotic dosing
- Prefer processed EEG monitoring
- Avoid gabapentinoids; minimize dex; slow titration; enhanced PACU monitoring

### Obesity/OSA risk
- Dose by appropriate scalars (IBW/AdjBW per agent)
- Lower opioid threshold; enhanced PACU monitoring
- Consider SAP as technical alternative for blocks

### Chronic opioid use
- Keep blocks + multimodal
- Anticipate higher rescue needs; coordinate continuation of baseline opioid regimen; involve pain team as needed

### Significant cardiac disease
- Avoid large hemodynamic swings
- Caution with ketamine (unstable CAD) and dex bolus
- Consider invasive monitoring for severe disease (attending judgment)

---

## Documentation Requirements (Educational Template)

### Preop
- Consent for GA + blocks (risks/benefits/alternatives)
- ASA class; Apfel score; comorbidity risk notes
- Rationale for selecting Protocol 1 and contingency plan

### Intraop
- Block details: side, LA type/concentration/volume, additives, total mg, dermatomes, complications
- Anesthetic details: technique, infusion rates, hemodynamics, fluids, antiemetics, reversal

### PACU handoff
- Block function assessment
- Total intraop opioids (target 0 for Protocol 1)
- Rescue plan and monitoring considerations (OSA, frailty, bradycardia risk)

---

## Quality Metrics (Use Local QI Benchmarks)

Suggested tracking (institution dependent):
- Block success rate
- Rescue opioid use frequency and dose
- PONV incidence
- PACU length of stay
- Adverse events (LAST, hypotension/bradycardia requiring escalation)

> Replace any generic benchmarks with **institutional QI data** wherever possible.

---

## Evidence Base (Populate with Specific Citations in Repository)

### Guidelines / advisories (examples)
1. Regional anesthesia guidance for breast surgery (e.g., ASRA)
2. ERAS breast reconstruction guidance (ERAS Society)
3. LAST management checklist (ASRA)
4. Multimodal analgesia / opioid stewardship guidance (ASA/APSF)

### Supporting literature categories
- PECS/SAP efficacy trials and meta-analyses
- OFA/OFS (opioid-free/opioid-sparing) outcomes in breast surgery populations
- Dexmedetomidine as adjunct (benefits/risks)
- Ketamine analgesia heterogeneity and phenotype moderation

---

## Appendices

### Appendix A — PECS/SAP Sonoanatomy Checklist
- Pec major, pec minor, serratus anterior, ribs/pleura, relevant vessels (Doppler)

### Appendix B — Local anesthetic dose calculator (educational)
- Calculate max allowable mg by weight (per institutional policy)
- Convert concentration to mg/mL
- Ensure planned total mg < max allowable mg
- Use conservative dosing when combining systemic lidocaine infusion + large-volume plane blocks

> **Note:** IV lidocaine infusion and large-volume regional blocks increase cumulative local anesthetic exposure and merit conservative dosing and heightened vigilance.
