# **At a Glance**

**What:**  
A concise, evidence-informed perioperative framework for **post-mastectomy breast implant revision**, including:
- A complete surgical workflow (explant → washout → pocket revision → implant placement)
- Three anesthesia pathways (opioid-free w/ blocks, opioid-free without blocks, opioid-based)
- A comprehensive PACU + discharge sequence

**Who:**  
Plastic surgeons, anesthesiologists, CRNAs, residents, and trainees reviewing best practices for revision breast reconstruction after mastectomy.

**Why:**  
Revision reconstruction carries higher risks of pain, infection, capsular pathology, and PONV.  
This project standardizes decision-making across surgical and anesthesia teams to support:
- Patient comfort  
- Opioid stewardship  
- Regional anesthesia utilization  
- Clear communication of expectations and roles  
- Safe, stepwise perioperative management  

This protocol is educational and not a substitute for clinical judgment.

# **Clinical Scope**

### **Procedure Focus**
Post-mastectomy implant revision with:
- Removal of compromised implant  
- Culture collection if infection suspected  
- Pocket washout & debridement  
- Capsulectomy or capsule modification as needed  
- New implant selection & placement  
- Possible drain placement  
- Postoperative compression garment protocol  

### **Patient Archetype**
- Female, age 50–75  
- ASA II–III  
- History of bilateral mastectomy  
- Prior implant complication (infection, malposition, capsular contracture, rupture)  
- Prefers **opioid-sparing or opioid-free anesthesia**  
- Prefers **minimal needle sticks** (alternative pathways provided)

---

# **Anesthesia Options**

### **Option 1 — Opioid-Free Multimodal GA + PECS/Serratus Blocks (Preferred)**
- Ultrasound-guided PECS I + II OR serratus plane block  
- Induction with propofol + small-dose ketamine + lidocaine bolus  
- Dexmedetomidine infusion for analgesia & hemodynamic stability  
- No intraoperative opioids  
- Lowest risk of PONV  
- Highest analgesic quality

### **Option 2 — Opioid-Free GA Without Regional Blocks**
- Suitable for patients preferring fewer needle sticks  
- Relies on:
  - Lidocaine infusion  
  - Dexmedetomidine  
  - Ketamine microdose  
  - Surgeon-administered local infiltration  
- Slightly higher postoperative discomfort than block-based approach

### **Option 3 — Conventional Opioid-Based GA (Fallback Option)**
- For patients declining multimodal or with contraindications  
- Uses fentanyl or hydromorphone  
- Standard sevoflurane maintenance  
- Higher risk of PONV and slower emergence
