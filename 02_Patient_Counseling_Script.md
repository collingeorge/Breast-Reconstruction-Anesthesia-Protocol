## Purpose
A compassionate, easy-to-understand script for preoperative counseling and informed consent.  
Designed to be read aloud to the patient (or given as a take-home handout) and copied directly into the EMR.

---

## 1. Opening — Building Trust
**Provider script (say warmly):**

> “Hi [Patient Name], today I’d like to walk you through exactly what will happen with your upcoming breast implant revision surgery — step by step — and go over the different anesthesia choices we have. My goal is for you to feel completely informed and comfortable with the plan.”

---

## 2. What the Surgery Involves (Plain Language)

> “This surgery is called a **revision of your breast implant after mastectomy**.  
> Here’s what will happen:
> 1. We reopen the previous scar (usually under the breast).  
> 2. Carefully remove the old implant that’s causing trouble.  
> 3. Thoroughly clean and wash the pocket where the implant sits.  
> 4. Remove any thick scar tissue if needed.  
> 5. Reshape the pocket so the new implant fits perfectly.  
> 6. Place a brand-new implant using a special sterile ‘no-touch’ technique.  
> 7. Close the incision neatly and put on a supportive surgical bra.  
>   
> Sometimes a tiny drain is placed to prevent fluid buildup — we’ll know once we’re in surgery.”

## 3. What You Can Expect Afterward

| Recovery Aspect         | Typical Timeline                              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Pain / discomfort       | Mild-to-moderate pressure for 2–3 days        |
| Arm movement            | Keep arms below shoulder level first week     |
| Surgical bra            | Wear 24/7 for 2–6 weeks                       |
| Drains (if used)        | Usually removed in 3–7 days                   |
| Return to light activity| Within a few days                             |
| Heavy lifting / exercise| 4–6 weeks                                     |
| Follow-up visits        | 24 hours → 1 week → 6 weeks                   |

## 4. Benefits of This Surgery
- Better shape and symmetry  
- Relief from pain, tightness, or infection  
- A fresh start with a healthy new implant  
- Lower chance of future problems

---

## 5. Risks (Explained Honestly & Calmly)

> “Like any surgery, there are some risks, though most patients do very well. These include:”
> - Infection, bleeding, or fluid collection  
> - Asymmetry or need for another touch-up later  
> - Scarring or delayed healing  
> - New implant shifting or capsular contracture (scar tissue hardening)  
> - Very rare anesthesia complications (nausea, sore throat, or extremely rare heart/lung issues)

We do everything possible to keep these risks as low as possible.

## 6. Your Three Anesthesia Choices (Patient-Friendly)

| Option | How It Feels for You | Nausea Risk | Needle Sticks | Best For |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Option 1**<br>**Opioid-Free + Nerve Blocks** (Our favorite) | Deep sleep + chest stays numb for 12–24 hours → very little pain when you wake up | Lowest | IV + ultrasound-guided chest blocks (2–4 small injections) | Maximum comfort, least nausea, avoiding opioids |
| **Option 2**<br>**Opioid-Free, No Blocks** | Deep sleep, comfort from IV medicines only | Low | Only the IV | Fewer needles, still avoids opioids |
| **Option 3**<br>**Traditional Opioid-Based** | Deep sleep, uses fentanyl-type medicines | Higher | Only the IV | Familiar method, or if blocks aren’t possible |

**Most patients choose Option 1 or 2 and are pleasantly surprised how good they feel afterward.**

---

## 7. Suggested Provider Script for Decision-Making

> “The biggest difference is comfort versus needles.  
> If you hate nausea and want to feel the best possible when you wake up, the nerve-block option (Option 1) is usually the winner.  
> If you really don’t like extra needles, we can still keep you opioid-free with Option 2 and you’ll still do great.  
> Traditional anesthesia (Option 3) is always there if needed.  
> Which of these feels right for you?”

---

## 8. Pain Control After Surgery

> “Even without opioids during surgery, we have excellent ways to keep you comfortable: Tylenol, anti-inflammatory medicine, nerve blocks, and gentle IV medications. Most patients use little or no opioid pills at home — but they’re available if you need them.”
