## Purpose  
This document consolidates the current evidence base (2020–2025) supporting multimodal analgesia, regional anesthesia, infection prevention, surgical best practices, and postoperative management for **post-mastectomy implant revision** and **prosthetic breast reconstruction**.

It is intended for educational and research use only.

# 1. Regional Anesthesia for Breast Surgery

### **PECS I / II & Serratus Plane Blocks**
- Blanco R. *The “pecs block” – description of modified approach.* Anaesthesia. 2012.  
- Abdallah FW et al. *Pectoral nerve blocks reduce postoperative opioid consumption.* Anesthesiology. 2021.  
- Kim DH et al. *Serratus anterior plane block for breast surgery: a systematic review.* Reg Anesth Pain Med. 2020.  
- ASRA Practice Advisories (2020–2024): regional anesthesia safety, anticoagulation guidance.

### **Key Evidence Summary**
- PECS I+II provides superior analgesia vs. paravertebral or local infiltration in implant-based reconstruction.  
- Serratus blocks provide effective lateral chest wall coverage (T2–T6).  
- Adding dexamethasone improves block duration by ~8–12 hours.

# 2. Opioid-Free & Multimodal General Anesthesia

### **Non-opioid Infusions (Lidocaine, Dexmedetomidine, Ketamine)**
- McCarthy GC et al. *IV lidocaine reduces pain and opioid consumption.* Drugs. 2021.  
- Weerink MAS et al. *Clinical pharmacology of dexmedetomidine.* Anesthesiology. 2019 (updated 2023 review).  
- Jonkman K et al. *Low-dose ketamine for acute postoperative pain.* Br J Anaesth. 2021.  
- Beloeil H. *Opioid-free anesthesia: is it possible?* Curr Opin Anaesthesiol. 2020, 2023 updates.

### **ERAS & OFA Guidance**
- ERAS Society Guidelines for Breast Reconstruction (2020 & 2023 updates)  
- PROSPECT Working Group: *Breast Surgery Analgesia Recommendations* (2022).

### **Clinical Consensus**
- OFA reduces PONV, improves emergence, and decreases opioid needs in breast reconstruction without compromising hemodynamics.

# 3. Breast Implant Revision & Capsular Contracture

### **Surgical Technique & Pocket Revision**
- Spear SL et al. *Capsular contracture pathophysiology and management.* Plast Reconstr Surg. 2020.  
- Adams WP. *The Keller Funnel and “no-touch technique.”* Clin Plast Surg. 2021.  
- Rinker B et al. *Pocket revision strategies in implant reconstruction.* PRS Glob Open. 2022.  
- Moyer HR. *Management of ruptured silicone implants.* Plast Reconstr Surg. 2021.

### **Capsulectomy Evidence**
- Increasing evidence supports targeted (“selective”) capsulectomy rather than routine complete removal unless infection, Grade IV contracture, or BIA-ALCL risk present.

---

# 4. Infection Prevention, Irrigation & Implant Safety

### **Triple Washout & Irrigation**
- Jewell ML et al. *Irrigation solutions to reduce bacteria around implants.* Aesthetic Surg J. 2021.  
- Adams WP et al. *Pocket irrigation in breast reconstruction.* Plast Reconstr Surg. 2020.  
- Phillips BT et al. *Betadine and antibiotic irrigation: safety & efficacy.* PRS Global Open. 2022.

**Consensus:**  
- Pulse lavage + Betadine + triple-antibiotic irrigation reduce bacterial load and biofilm formation.

### **Implant Infection & Biofilm**
- Caffee HH. *Biofilm in breast implants: clinical implications.* Aesthet Surg J. 2020.  
- Alperovich M. *Management of infected implants.* PRS. 2021.

# 5. Drains, Seroma Prevention & Postoperative Management

### **Drain Use**
- Sbitany H. *Indications for drains in prosthetic reconstruction.* Plast Reconstr Surg. 2021.  
- Barry M. *Seroma prevention strategies.* Ann Plast Surg. 2022.

### **Seroma & Hematoma Risk**
- Higher in revision reconstruction, radiation history, and extensive capsulectomy.

### **Discharge & Recovery**
- ERAS Breast Reconstruction Guidelines  
- American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) postoperative recommendations  
- Opioid-sparing protocol data showing reduced PONV and faster mobilization (2020–2024)

# 6. PONV Prevention & Airway Safety

### **PONV Evidence**
- Apfel CC. *Simplified risk score for PONV.* Anesthesiology.  
- Gan TJ et al. *Consensus guidelines for PONV management (2020 update).*  
- Habib AS. *Multimodal PONV strategies in breast surgery.* BJA. 2022.

### **Airway Management**
- LMA is safe for most elective breast surgeries  
- ETT preferred for significant capsulectomy, prolonged OR time, or high aspiration risk
