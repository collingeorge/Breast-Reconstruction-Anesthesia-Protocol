## Detailed Workflow

### T-60 min Preoperative Holding
**Surgeon** – Mark IMF, midline, pocket limits; confirm implant inventory  
**Anesthesia** – Premedication, IV, antibiotics  
**Nursing** – Consent, implant lot numbers, OR readiness

### T-30 min Optional Regional Block (Protocol 1)
**Anesthesia** – PECS I+II or Serratus plane block under ultrasound  
**Surgeon** – Light palpation to confirm coverage

### T-0 min OR Entry & Safety Timeout

#### Mandatory Safety Checkpoints
- [ ] Patient identity + laterality confirmed  
- [ ] Antibiotics <60 min  
- [ ] Backup implant sizes/profiles in room  
- [ ] Keller funnel opened on sterile field  
- [ ] Irrigation solutions labeled (saline, triple-antibiotic, Betadine)  
- [ ] Electrocautery grounding pad placed  
- [ ] Discuss difficult dissection (radiation, fibrosis, infection)

**Positioning:** Supine, arms abducted <90°, forced-air warming blanket

### T+10 min Incision
- Re-open prior inframammary fold (IMF) scar (3–6 cm)  
- **If prior scar is inadequate, a short lateral extension may be created to improve exposure**  
- Electrocautery dissection to capsule

### T+20–40 min Explantation & Triple Washout
1. Carefully enter capsule  
2. Remove implant → inspect for rupture / biofilm  
3. **Explantation may be simple (implant removal only) or complex (explant + partial/total capsulectomy)**  
4. Send fluid or implant for culture if infection suspected  
5. **Triple-washout (standard)**  
   - Pulse lavage with ≥3 L warm saline  
   - Betadine soak 3–5 min (if no contraindication)  
   - Triple-antibiotic irrigation (cefazolin 2 g + gentamicin 80 mg + bacitracin 50,000 units per liter)

### T+40–60 min Pocket Revision & Capsulectomy
- Partial or total capsulectomy (Baker III–IV)  
- Medial release, lateral pillar plication, inferior pole reinforcement  
- **ADM reinforcement may be used selectively for lower-pole support (surgeon preference)**

### T+60–75 min Sizer → Final Implant
- Insert sizer with sterile technique  
- Sit patient to **45–80°** (surgeon preference) for symmetry & projection assessment  
- Final pocket adjustments  
- Remove sizer → insert definitive implant via **Keller funnel** (no-touch)  
- Final antibiotic rinse before closure

### Drain Placement Criteria (Place JP or Blake drain if ≥1)
- Suspected/confirmed infection  
- Extensive capsulectomy or raw surface area  
- History of seroma  
- Significant dissection in radiated tissue

### T+75–90 min Closure & Immediate Dressing
- 2-0 Vicryl (deep) → 3-0 Monocryl (subcuticular) → Dermabond + Steri-Strips  
- Light non-adherent dressing  
- Immediate postoperative surgical bra (fitted while patient still on table)

### T+90–100 min Emergence & PACU Transfer
**Anesthesia** – Stop infusions → reverse NMB → smooth wake-up  
**Target:** Pain ≤4/10 on arrival (Protocols 1 & 2)

- Montgomery or narrow Deaver retractors  
- Long insulated electrocautery tips  
- Pulse lavage system  
- Keller funnel (medium & large)

## Intraoperative Complication Quick Reference

| Complication                  | Immediate Management                                      |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Significant bleeding          | Electrocautery, Floseal/Surgiflo, temporary packing       |
| Gross implant rupture         | Send shell/fluid for culture, extended washout            |
| Capsular defect / hole        | Internal 2-0 Vicryl repair to re-establish boundaries    |
| Pocket too loose              | Capsulorrhaphy (lateral/superior plication)              |
| Pocket too tight              | Targeted releases (medial/inferior)                       |
| Unexpected purulence          | Cultures, extend antibiotics, consider drain placement    |

---

## Same-Day Discharge Criteria
- Pain ≤4/10 on oral regimen  
- Tolerating liquids, no nausea  
- Stable vitals ×1–2 hours  
- Ambulatory with assistance  
- Understands drain care & activity restrictions  
- Surgical bra comfortable
