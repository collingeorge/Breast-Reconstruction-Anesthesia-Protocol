## High-Level Timeline

| Time         | Phase                     | Key Actions                                                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **T-60 min** | Pre-op Holding            | Marking, final consent, antibiotics, premedication, pathway confirmation   |
| **T-30 min** | Block Room (if Protocol 1)| PECS I+II or Serratus block                                                |
| **T-0 min**  | OR Entry & Timeout        | Induction, positioning, full surgical safety checklist                     |
| **T+10 min** | Incision                  | Re-open prior IMF scar                                                     |
| **T+20–40**  | Explant + Washout         | Implant removal, cultures (if indicated), triple-washout                   |
| **T+40–60**  | Pocket Revision           | Capsulectomy, medial/lateral/inferior pole adjustments                    |
| **T+60–75**  | Sizer & Final Implant     | Semi-upright assessment → no-touch insertion                              |
| **T+75–90**  | Closure & Dressing        | Layered closure, drain(s) if indicated, surgical bra                       |
| **T+90–100** | Emergence & Transfer      | Smooth wake-up → PACU handoff                                              |

Average total OR time: **90–120 minutes**

## Detailed Workflow

### T-60 min Preoperative Holding
**Surgeon**  
- Confirm indication & laterality  
- Mark IMF, midline, pocket boundaries  
- Verify implant/sizer inventory  

**Anesthesia**  
- Confirm chosen protocol (1/2/3)  
- Administer acetaminophen, celecoxib ± gabapentin  
- IV placement + antibiotic prophylaxis  

**Nursing**  
- Consent verification  
- Implant lot number check  

### T-30 min Optional Block (Protocol 1 only)
**Anesthesia** → PECS I+II or Serratus plane block  
**Surgeon** → Light palpation to confirm coverage before induction  

### T-0 min OR Entry & Safety Timeout
- Patient identity, procedure, laterality  
- Implants available?  
- Antibiotics given <60 min?  
- Block performed?  
- Special concerns (infection, radiation, BIA-ALCL workup)

**Positioning:** Supine, arms abducted <90°, chest fully exposed  
**Warming:** Forced-air blanket  

### T+10 min Incision
- Re-open prior inframammary fold scar (3–5 cm)  
- Electrocautery dissection to capsule  

### T+20–40 min Explantation & Washout
1. Enter capsule  
2. Remove implant (send for pathology/culture if indicated)  
3. Inspect for rupture, biofilm, purulence  
4. **Triple-washout protocol** (standard):  
   - Pulse lavage with warm saline  
   - Betadine soak (if no allergy/thyroid issue)  
   - Triple-antibiotic irrigation (cefazolin + gentamicin + bacitracin)  

### T+40–60 min Pocket Revision
- Partial or total capsulectomy as needed (Baker III–IV)  
- Release medial/lateral/inferior constraints  
- Reconstruct pocket for optimal support and projection  

### T+60–75 min Sizer → Final Implant
- Insert sizer with sterile technique  
- Sit patient to 45–60° (semi-Fowler) → assess symmetry & contour  
- Final adjustments to pocket  
- Remove sizer → insert definitive implant via **Keller funnel** (no-touch)  
- Final antibiotic irrigation before closure  

### Drain Placement Criteria
Place JP or Blake drain if **any** of the following:  
- Suspected/confirmed infection  
- Extensive capsulectomy  
- Large raw surface area  
- History of seroma  

### T+75–90 min Closure & Dressing
- 2-0 Vicryl (deep) → 3-0 Monocryl (subcuticular) → Dermabond + Steri-Strips  
- Light non-adherent dressing  
- Immediate postoperative surgical bra (fitted in OR)

### T+90–100 min Emergence & PACU Transfer
**Anesthesia**  
- Stop infusions (dexmedetomidine/lidocaine)  
- Reverse NMB → smooth extubation/LMA removal  
- Target pain ≤4/10 on arrival  

**PACU Handoff Elements**  
- Block performed? Airway type EBL Drains?  
- PONV prophylaxis given Pain score Multimodal orders  

---

## Same-Day Discharge Criteria
- Pain ≤4/10 on oral regimen  
- Tolerating PO, no nausea  
- Stable vitals ×1–2 hours  
- Ambulatory with assistance  
- Understands drain care & activity restrictions  
- Surgical bra tolerated
