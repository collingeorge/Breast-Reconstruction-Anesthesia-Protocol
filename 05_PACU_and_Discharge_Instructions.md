|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Airway**  | Nasal cannula 2–4 L/min → titrate to SpO₂ ≥94%                         |
| **Circulation** | Vitals q15 min until stable; monitor for dexmedetomidine-related hypotension |
| **Pain**    | Assess q15 min → target pain ≤4/10 before discharge                     |
| **PONV**    | Treat promptly & aggressively (see below)                               |
| **Temperature** | Forced-air warming blanket until normothermic                      |

**Expected pain on arrival**  
- **Protocol 1:** 1–3/10  
- **Protocol 2:** 3–5/10

# Drain Care Education (If Drains Placed)

**Teach before discharge (patient + caregiver):**
- Empty & record output every 8–12 hours  
- Gently “milk” or strip tubing daily  
- Keep bulb compressed (active suction)  
- Secure drain to clothing to prevent pulling  
- Avoid submerging drain in water  

**Removal criteria:**  
<30 mL/24 h for 2 consecutive days + no signs of infection
