|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Airway      | Nasal cannula 2–4 L/min → titrate to SpO₂ ≥94%                         |
| Circulation | Vitals q15 min until stable; watch for dexmedetomidine-related hypotension |
| Pain        | Assess q15 min → target ≤4/10 before discharge                         |
| PONV        | Treat aggressively if present (see below)                              |
| Temperature | Forced-air warming blanket until normothermic                         |

**Expected pain on arrival**  
- Protocol 1: **1–3/10**  
- Protocol 2: **3–5/10**  
- Protocol 3: **5–7/10**
